# cause the sky
cause the sky full of stars
i'm goona give my heart
cause the sky
cause the sky full of stars
cause you light up the path 
i don't care,go on and tear me apart
i don't care if you do
cause in a sky
in a sky full of stars
i think i saw you
cause you're a sky 
cause you're a sky full of stars
i want to die in your arms,arms
cause you get the lighter more than it gets dark
i'm going to give you my heart
and i don't care
go on and take my apart 
and i don't care if you do
cause in a sky
in a sky full of stars
i think i see you
i think i see you
because you're a sky
you're a sky full of stars
such a heavenly view 
you're such a heavenly view
